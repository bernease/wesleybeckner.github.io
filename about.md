MD simulation is a powerful tool to both educate students and answer scientific questions. The researcher has extraordinary precision and control when creating experiments in silico. The data is easily shareable, computing resources are easily adapted to accommodate new research ideas and questions, and because MD is time-evolved, resultant trajectories can be used to cultivate intuition of chemistry at the molecular scale in aspiring students. These are some of the reasons I chose to pursue molecular modeling and data science as my graduate research area. 

Off UW campus you might find me climbing at the Seattle Bouldering Project, running around Green Lake or spending time with my family in Fort Worth, TX.
