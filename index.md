I am a Chemical Engineering graduate student and [ARCS fellow](http://seattlearcsfoundation.org/) at the University of Washington. I use molecular dynamics (MD) engines to develop insight into materials used for energy and medicine.  

Due to the generation of extremely large datasets, my work also necessitates the use of the latest "Big Data" analysis tools. The creation of these datasets are made possible by the [high performance computing](http://www.washington.edu/itconnect/research/hpc/) resources at UW.
